## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Toolbar Visible and Centered
expected: A GitKraken-style toolbar appears in the header area (between the tab bar and main content). It shows five buttons: Pull, Push, Branch, Stash, Pop — centered horizontally. Pull button has a small chevron/arrow on its right side for the dropdown.
result: pass

### 2. Pull Dropdown Strategies
expected: Clicking the chevron on the Pull button opens a dropdown showing four options: Fetch, Fast-forward if possible, Fast-forward only, Pull (rebase). Clicking outside the dropdown closes it.
result: pass

### 3. Status Bar Visible at Bottom
expected: A permanent status bar is visible at the bottom of the window. When idle, it shows branch/remote info or last operation result. It is always present, not just during operations.
result: pass

### 4. Fetch with Progress Feedback
expected: Clicking "Fetch" (from the Pull dropdown) starts a fetch of all remotes. The status bar shows a spinner and real-time progress text (e.g., "Receiving objects: 45%"). When complete, the commit graph updates.
result: pass

### 5. Pull Current Branch
expected: Clicking the Pull button (main button, not chevron) pulls the current branch respecting your gitconfig. The status bar shows progress during the operation. When complete, the commit graph updates with any new commits.
result: pass

### 6. Push Current Branch
expected: Clicking the Push button pushes the current branch. The status bar shows progress. When complete, the commit graph updates. Push respects your gitconfig push.default and push.autoSetupRemote settings.
result: pass

### 7. Buttons Disabled During Operation
expected: While any remote operation is running (fetch/pull/push), all remote-related toolbar buttons (Pull, Push) are disabled/grayed out. They re-enable when the operation completes.
result: pass

### 8. Cancel Running Operation
expected: During a remote operation, the status bar shows a cancel button (X). Clicking it stops the operation. The status bar returns to idle state and buttons re-enable.
result: issue
reported: "pass, but it's all the way to the right, that's hard to miss, we should find a better (closer) place for it"
severity: minor

### 9. Auth Failure Error Message
expected: If a remote operation fails due to authentication (e.g., invalid SSH key or credentials), the status bar displays an error with an actionable hint like "Authentication failed — check your SSH key or credential helper". The error persists until the next operation.
result: pass

### 10. Non-Fast-Forward "Pull Now" Action
expected: If a push is rejected because the remote has newer commits (non-fast-forward), the status bar shows an error with a clickable "Pull now" action. Clicking "Pull now" triggers a pull operation.
result: pass

### 11. Branch Button Opens Dialog
expected: Clicking the Branch toolbar button opens a create-branch dialog (reusing the InputDialog from Phase 12). You can type a branch name and create it.
result: pass

### 12. Stash and Pop Buttons
expected: Clicking Stash saves the current working changes (same as the existing stash save). Clicking Pop applies the top stash entry (same as existing stash pop). Both trigger the commit graph to update.
result: issue
reported: "clicking stash does nothing; pop is not working either"
severity: major

## Gaps

- truth: "Cancel button is easily accessible during remote operations"
  status: resolved
  reason: "User reported: cancel button is all the way to the right, hard to find, should be closer to the progress text"
  severity: minor
  test: 8
  root_cause: ".status-text has flex: 1 which greedily fills remaining space, pushing cancel button to far right"
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/components/StatusBar.svelte"
      issue: ".status-text flex: 1 pushes cancel button to far right (line 139)"
  missing:
    - "Remove flex: 1 from .status-text so cancel button sits adjacent to progress text"

- truth: "Clicking Stash saves current working changes and clicking Pop applies top stash"
  status: resolved
  reason: "User reported: clicking stash does nothing; pop is not working either"
  severity: major
  test: 12
  root_cause: "handleStash calls safeInvoke('stash_save', {path}) but Rust command requires {path, message}. handlePop calls safeInvoke('stash_pop', {path}) but Rust command requires {path, index}. Empty catch {} blocks silently swallow the IPC deserialization errors."
  artifacts:

      issue: "handleStash missing message param (line 41); handlePop missing index param (line 49); empty catch blocks (lines 42-44)"

    - "Add index: 0 to stash_pop invocation"
